<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Boooks is a library management system that is designed to manage all the functions of a library. It helps the librarian to maintain the database of new books and the books that are borrowed by the members along with their due dates.

This system completely automates all your library's activities. The best way to maintain, organize and handle countless books systematically is to implement a library management system software.

You can find books in an instant, issue/reissue books quickly, and manage all the data efficiently and orderly using this system. The purpose of a library management system is to provide instant and accurate data regarding any type of book, thereby saving a lot of time and effort.
